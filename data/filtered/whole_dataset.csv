This assay is based on the ability of HeLa nuclear extract, which is enriched in HDAC activity, to mediate the deacetylation of the acetylated lysine side chain of the Fluor de Lys substrate. The assay procedure requires two steps. First, incubation of the HeLa nuclear extract with the Fluor de Lys substrate results in substrate deacetylation and thus sensitizes it to the second step.

The kit is a highly sensitive and convenient alternative to radiolabeled, acetylated histones or peptide/HPLC methods for the assay of histone deacetylases. This assay is based on the ability of HeLa nuclear extract, which is enriched in HDAC activity, to mediate the deacetylation of the acetylated lysine side chain of the Fluor de Lys substrate. The assay procedure requires two steps. First, incubation of the HeLa nuclear extract with the Fluor de Lys substrate results in substrate deacetylation and thus sensitizes it to the second step. In the second step, treatment of the deacetylated substrate with the Fluor de Lys developer produces a fluorophore.

After incubation with HDAC, deacetylation of the substrate sensitizes the substrate such that, in a second step, treatment with the detection enzyme produces a fluorophore. HDACs 1 and 6 were expressed as full length fusion proteins. Purified proteins were incubated with 50 μM fluorescently-labeled acetylated peptide substrate and test compound for 2 hours at RT in HDAC assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1% DMSO, and 1% BSA. Reactions were terminated by the addition of the Developer after 2 hours, and the development of fluorescence signal, which was relative to the amount of deacetylated peptide, was monitored by time-course measurement of EnVision (PerkinElmer).

The kit is a highly sensitive and convenient alternative to radiolabeled, acetylated histones or peptide/HPLC methods for the assay of histone deacetylases. This assay is based on the ability of HeLa nuclear extract, which is enriched in HDAC activity, to mediate the deacetylation of the acetylated lysine side chain of the Fluor de Lys substrate. The assay procedure requires two steps. First, incubation of the HeLa nuclear extract with the Fluor de Lys substrate results in substrate deacetylation and thus sensitizes it to the second step. In the second step, treatment of the deacetylated substrate with the Fluor de Lys developer produces a fluorophore.

This assay is based on the ability of HeLa nuclear extract, which is enriched in HDAC activity, to mediate the deacetylation of the acetylated lysine side chain of the Fluor de Lys substrate. The assay procedure requires two steps. First, incubation of the HeLa nuclear extract with the Fluor de Lys substrate results in substrate deacetylation and thus sensitizes it to the second step. In the second step, treatment of the deacetylated substrate with the Fluor de Lys developer produces a fluorophore.

The kit is a highly sensitive and convenient alternative to radiolabeled, acetylated histones or peptide/HPLC methods for the assay of histone deacetylases. This assay is based on the ability of HeLa nuclear extract, which is enriched in HDAC activity, to mediate the deacetylation of the acetylated lysine side chain of the Fluor de Lys substrate. The assay procedure requires two steps. First, incubation of the HeLa nuclear extract with the Fluor de Lys substrate results in substrate deacetylation and thus sensitizes it to the second step. In the second step, treatment of the deacetylated substrate with the Fluor de Lys developer produces a fluorophore.

The kit is a highly sensitive and convenient alternative to radiolabeled, acetylated histones or peptide/HPLC methods for the assay of histone deacetylases. This assay is based on the ability of HeLa nuclear extract, which is enriched in HDAC activity, to mediate the deacetylation of the acetylated lysine side chain of the Fluor de Lys substrate. The assay procedure requires two steps. First, incubation of the HeLa nuclear extract with the Fluor de Lys substrate results in substrate deacetylation and thus sensitizes it to the second step. In the second step, treatment of the deacetylated substrate with the Fluor de Lys developer produces a fluorophore.

The kit is a highly sensitive and convenient alternative to radiolabeled, acetylated histones or peptide/HPLC methods for the assay of histone deacetylases. This assay is based on the ability of HeLa nuclear extract, which is enriched in HDAC activity, to mediate the deacetylation of the acetylated lysine side chain of the Fluor de Lys substrate. The assay procedure requires two steps. First, incubation of the HeLa nuclear extract with the Fluor de Lys substrate results in substrate deacetylation and thus sensitizes it to the second step. In the second step, treatment of the deacetylated substrate with the Fluor de Lys developer produces a fluorophore.

After incubation with HDAC, deacetylation of the substrate sensitizes the substrate such that, in a second step, treatment with the detection enzyme produces a fluorophore. HDACs 1 and 6 were expressed as full length fusion proteins. Purified proteins were incubated with 50 μM fluorescently-labeled acetylated peptide substrate and test compound for 2 hours at room temperature in HDAC assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1% DMSO, and 1% BSA. Reactions were terminated by the addition of the Developer after 2 hours, and the development of fluorescence signal, which was relative to the amount of deacetylated peptide, was monitored by time-course measurement of EnVision (PerkinElmer).

Substrate solution was prepared as follow: Boc(Lys-Ac)-AMC was dissolved in DMSO and diluted with HDAC buffer (15 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.1], 250 Î¼M EDTA, 250 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol) to give 1 mM solutions containing 1.7% DMSO. Trypsin was used to stop the reaction, releasing free AMC. The trypsin solution was prepared as follow: trypsin was dissolved in HDAC buffer to give a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Release of AMC was monitored by measuring the fluorescence at 460 nm (lex=390 nm) with a microplate reader (SpectraMax Gemini) at 37° C. The AMC signals were recorded against a blank with buffer, substrate and trypsin but without the enzyme. All experiments were carried out at least in triplicate. For HDAC inhibition assays, inhibitor diluted in 50 μL of HDAC buffer was mixed with 10 μL of diluted enzyme solution in HDAC buffer at room temperature. The HDAC reaction was started by adding 40 μL of substrate solution in HDAC buffer followed by 30 min of incubation with stirring at 37° C. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μL, of trypsin solution. After a 10 min incubation with stirring at 37° C., the release of AMC was monitored by measuring the fluorescence.",B,BAO_0000357,single protein format,Homo sapiens,,,,,,,,CHEMBL1865,Histone deacetylase 6,Homo sapiens,SINGLE PROTEIN,CHEMBL3886894,37,BindingDB Database,,2016,,,,,2

After incubation with HDAC, deacetylation of the substrate sensitizes the substrate such that, in a second step, treatment with the detection enzyme produces a fluorophore. HDACs 1 and 6 were expressed as full length fusion proteins. Purified proteins were incubated with 50 μM fluorescently-labeled acetylated peptide substrate and test compound for 2 hours at RT in HDAC assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1% DMSO, and 1% BSA. Reactions were terminated by the addition of the Developer after 2 hours, and the development of fluorescence signal, which was relative to the amount of deacetylated peptide, was monitored by time-course measurement of EnVision (PerkinElmer).

After the substrate was deacetylated by HDACs, the product AMC which was obtained from hydrolysis by trypsin can generate fluorescence signal. Measurement is taken in using an multilabe plate reader a 355 nm excitation filter and a 460 nm emission filter.

Trypsin was used to stop the reaction, releasing free AMC. The trypsin solution was prepared as follow: trypsin was dissolved in HDAC buffer to give a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Release of AMC was monitored by measuring the fluorescence at 460 nm (lex=390 nm) with a microplate reader (SpectraMax Gemini) at 37° C. The AMC signals were recorded against a blank with buffer, substrate and trypsin but without the enzyme. All experiments were carried out at least in triplicate. For HDAC inhibition assays, inhibitor diluted in 50 μL of HDAC buffer was mixed with 10 μL of diluted enzyme solution in HDAC buffer at room temperature. The HDAC reaction was started by adding 40 μL of substrate solution in HDAC buffer followed by 30 min of incubation with stirring at 37° C.

Trypsin was used to stop the reaction, releasing free AMC. The trypsin solution was prepared as follow: trypsin was dissolved in HDAC buffer to give a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Release of AMC was monitored by measuring the fluorescence at 460 nm (lex=390 nm) with a microplate reader (SpectraMax Gemini) at 37° C. The AMC signals were recorded against a blank with buffer, substrate and trypsin but without the enzyme. All experiments were carried out at least in triplicate. For HDAC inhibition assays, inhibitor diluted in 50 μL of HDAC buffer was mixed with 10 μL of diluted enzyme solution in HDAC buffer at room temperature. The HDAC reaction was started by adding 40 μL of substrate solution in HDAC buffer followed by 30 min of incubation with stirring at 37° C. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μL, of trypsin solution.
